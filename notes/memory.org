* Memory Management
  The *sys_brk()* system call is provided by the kernel, to allocate memory without the need
  of moving it later. This call allocates memory right behind the application image in the memory.
  This system function allows you to set the highest available address in the data section.

  This system call takes one parameter, which is the highest memory address needed to be set.
  This value is stored in the *EBX* register.

  In case of any error, *sys_brk()* returns -1 or returns the negative error code itself.
