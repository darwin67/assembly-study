* Macro
  - A macro is a sequence of instructions, assigned by a name and could be used anywhere in the program.
  - The macro begins with the *%macro* directive and ends with the *%endmacro* directives.

  #+NAME: Macro
   #+BEGIN_SRC asm
      %macro macro_name  number_of_params
      <macro body>
      %endmacro
   #+END_SRC

   Where, *number_of_params* specifies the number parameters, *macro_name* specifies the name of the macro.

   The macro is invoked by using the macro name along with the necessary parameters. When you need to use
   some sequence of instructions many times in a program, you can put those instructions in a macro and use
   it instead of writing the instructions all the time.
