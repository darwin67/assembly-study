* Loops
** JMP
   The JMP instruction can be used for implementing loops.
   For example, the following code snippet can be used for executing the loop-body 10 times.

   #+NAME: LOOP
   #+BEGIN_SRC asm
         mov cl, 10
     l1:
         ;; loop body
         dec cl
         jnz l1                      ; repeat l1 if cl != 0
   #+END_SRC

** LOOP
   The *LOOP* instruction assumes that the *ECX register contains the loop count*. When the
   loop instruction is executed, the ECX register is decremented and the control jumps to the
   target label, until the ECX register value, i.e., the counter reaches the value zero.

   #+NAME: LOOP
   #+BEGIN_SRC asm
         mov exc, 10
     l1:
         ;; loop body
         loop l1
   #+END_SRC
